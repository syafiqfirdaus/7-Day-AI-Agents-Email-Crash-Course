This object represents the duration between two timestamps in terms of days, seconds, and microseconds. To convert this duration to hours, you can manually calculate the total duration by converting days to hours and adding the hours derived from seconds.\n\nHere's how you can do the conversion:\n\n1. Calculate the difference between two timestamps, which yields a `timedelta` object.\n2. Convert the days and seconds from the `timedelta` object to hours. You can do this using:\n   - Total hours = (days * 24) + (seconds / 3600)\n\nAlternatively, you can also use the `datediff` SQL function to get the difference in days and subsequently multiply the result by 24 to convert it to hours. Here\u2019s the method:\n\n- Use the `datediff` function:\n  - **Upper Date (closer date)**: e.g., `dropoff_datetime`\n  - **Lower Date (farther date)**: e.g., `pickup_datetime`\n  \nThis function returns the difference in days, which you can then convert to hours by multiplying by 24.\n\nFor example:\n```python\nfrom pyspark.sql import SparkSession\nfrom pyspark.sql.functions import col, datediff\n\nspark = SparkSession.builder.appName(\"Timestamp Difference\").getOrCreate()\n\n# Assume df is your DataFrame with two TimestampType columns\ndf.withColumn(\"hour_difference\", datediff(col(\"dropoff_datetime\"), col(\"pickup_datetime\")) * 24).show()\n```\n\nFor additional details, you can refer to the source material: [Homework: how to convert the time difference of two timestamps to hours](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/faq/blob/main/_questions/data-engineering-zoomcamp/module-5/053_1da0437718_homework-how-to-convert-the-time-difference-of-two.md).",

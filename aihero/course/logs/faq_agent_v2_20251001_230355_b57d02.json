          "content": "### Port Mapping and Networks in Docker\n\nFor information on port mapping in Docker, you can check the following guidance:\n\n1. **Port Conflicts**: If you encounter an error like `Error - postgres port is already in use`, you need to identify which service is using the port (commonly 5432 for PostgreSQL) and either stop that service or map your Docker container to a different port (e.g., 5433). You can identify the service by running:\n   ```bash\n   sudo lsof -i :5432\n   ```\n   If you need to map a different port for your Docker setup, adjust your `docker-compose.yml` or Docker command accordingly.\n\n   For a longer-term solution, updating your Docker configuration to avoid port conflicts is advisable ([source](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/faq/blob/main/faq-main/_questions/data-engineering-zoomcamp/module-1/070_f291e8d311_postgres-bind-address-already-in-use.md)).\n\n### Troubleshooting Steps for PostgreSQL on macOS\n\nIf you're facing issues with PostgreSQL on macOS, consider the following troubleshooting steps:\n\n1. **Check for Port Conflicts**:\n   Ensure that port 5432 is available and not being used by another installation of PostgreSQL. You can check what's using the port with:\n   ```bash\n   sudo lsof -i :5432\n   ```\n\n2. **Service Conflicts**:\n   If you're getting authentication or connection errors, it could be due to another PostgreSQL service running on your machine. Stop any other running PostgreSQL services if necessary.\n\n3. **Permission Issues**:\n   If you encounter permission errors when creating a PostgreSQL Docker container with a mounted volume, ensure you are not running another conflicting application (like Rancher Desktop) and switch to using Docker Desktop if needed. An error message like:\n   ```\n   permission denied error while creating mount source path\n   ```\n   indicates such issues. You may need to create local Docker volumes instead of mounting local directories ([source](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/faq/blob/main/faq-main/_questions/data-engineering-zoomcamp/module-1/013_0beb2b5df7_docker-permission-denied-error-when-creating-a-pos.md)).\n\n4. **Password Authentication Failures**:\n   Ensure that the credentials you're using to connect to PostgreSQL are correct, and that PostgreSQL is listening on the right port. If you're facing errors about authentication, double-check the `POSTGRES_USER` and `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` in your connection string ([source](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/faq/blob/main/faq-main/_questions/data-engineering-zoomcamp/module-1/073_60c212c0e8_postgres-connection-failed-connection-to-server-at.md)).\n\nFor detailed guides, check out:\n- Setting up Docker on macOS [here](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/faq/blob/main/faq-main/_questions/data-engineering-zoomcamp/module-1/020_b2eabcd7dc_docker-setting-up-docker-on-mac.md). \n\nFollow these steps and references to troubleshoot effectively!",

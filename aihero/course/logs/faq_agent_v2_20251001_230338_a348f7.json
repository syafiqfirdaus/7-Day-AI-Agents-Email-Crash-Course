If the file extension is `csv.gz` instead of `csv`, it won't store correctly.\n\nTo handle this:\n\n1. Replace `csv_name = \"output.csv\"` with the file name extracted from the URL. For example, for the yellow taxi data, use:\n   \n   ```python\n   url = \"https://github.com/DataTalksClub/nyc-tlc-data/releases/download/yellow/yellow_tripdata_2021-01.csv.gz\"\n   csv_name = url.split(\"/\")[-1]\n   ```\n\n2. When you use `csv_name` with `pandas.read_csv`, it will work correctly because `pandas.read_csv` can directly read files with the `csv.gz` extension.\n\nExample:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\nurl = \"https://github.com/DataTalksClub/nyc-tlc-data/releases/download/yellow/yellow_tripdata_2021-01.csv.gz\"\ncsv_name = url.split(\"/\")[-1]\n\ndata = pd.read_csv(csv_name)\n```",

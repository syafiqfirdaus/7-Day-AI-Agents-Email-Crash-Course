This is because pandas by default will parse integer columns with missing values as float type.\n\nSolution:\n\nOne way to solve this problem is to specify or cast the data type as `Int64` during the data transformation stage.\n\nIf specifying all the integer columns is inconvenient, you can use `convert_dtypes` to infer the data type automatically.\n\n- Make pandas infer the correct data type (as pandas parse int with missing as float):\n\n```python\n# Fill missing values with a placeholder\n df.fillna(-999999, inplace=True)\n\n# Infer data types\n df = df.convert_dtypes()\n\n# Replace placeholder with None\n df = df.replace(-999999, None)\n```",

For example:\n   ```bash\n   conda install pandas\n   ```\n\n3. **Use a VPN**: Sometimes, network restrictions can cause issues. Using a VPN can sometimes help bypass these.\n\n4. **Upgrade Pip**: Make sure you are using the latest version of pip:\n   ```bash\n   pip install --upgrade pip\n   ```\n\n5. **Specify a Proxy**: If you're behind a proxy, you can configure pip to use it:\n   ```bash\n   pip install --proxy http://proxy:port pandas\n   ```\n\n6. **Try Installing from an Alternate Source**: If the issue persists, you might want to try downloading the package manually from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/pandas/) and then install it by running:\n   ```bash\n   pip install /path/to/downloaded/pandas.whl\n   ```\n\nIf the issue continues, you may want to consult the official Python or pandas installation documentation for more detailed troubleshooting.",

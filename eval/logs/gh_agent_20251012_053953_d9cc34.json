If the file extension is `csv.gz` instead of `csv`, it won't store correctly.\n\nTo handle this:\n\n1. Replace `csv_name = \"output.csv\"` with the file name extracted from the URL. For example, for the yellow taxi data, use:\n   \n   ```python\n   url = \"https://github.com/DataTalksClub/nyc-tlc-data/releases/download/yellow/yellow_tripdata_2021-01.csv.gz\"\n   csv_name = url.split(\"/\")[-1]\n   ```\n\n2. When you use `csv_name` with `pandas.read_csv`, it will work correctly because `pandas.read_csv` can directly read files with the `csv.gz` extension.\n\nExample:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\nurl = \"https://github.com/DataTalksClub/nyc-tlc-data/releases/download/yellow/yellow_tripdata_2021-01.csv.gz\"\ncsv_name = url.split(\"/\")[-1]\n\ndata = pd.read_csv(csv_name)\n```",

          "content": "If your data loading process for yellow taxi data is too slow, here are some steps you can follow to improve efficiency:\n\n1. **Use Parquet Files**: Instead of downloading CSV files, consider downloading and using Parquet files directly. Parquet files are optimized for performance and can significantly reduce loading times because they are compressed and allow for faster queries and data processing.\n\n2. **Batch Data Loading**: If you're downloading the data in multiple smaller files, consider batching the operations to reduce overhead. Loading a larger file might be more efficient than loading many smaller files.\n\n3. **Local Environment**: If you are experiencing bandwidth issues or slow data loading using a cloud environment (such as Google Cloud Storage), try loading the data using a local environment (like Jupyter notebooks). This can help alleviate some of the latency involved with cloud services.\n\n4. **Script Optimization**: Make sure that your script is optimized for data loading. This includes using efficient libraries (like Pandas for data manipulation) and methods that handle large datasets more effectively. \n\n5. **Using Caching**: If you use data frequently, consider implementing caching strategies to avoid downloading the same data multiple times. You can store processed data locally or in a more accessible format.\n\n6. **Ensure Proper Use of `pandas.read_csv`**: When loading `.csv.gz` files, make sure to use the appropriate method in pandas:\n   ```python\n   import pandas as pd\n   url = \"https://github.com/DataTalksClub/nyc-tlc-data/releases/download/yellow/yellow_tripdata_2021-01.csv.gz\"\n   data = pd.read_csv(url)  # pandas can read gzip file directly.\n   ```\n\nFor more details, you can refer to the following articles and resources:\n- **Loading Data Efficiently**: You might find tips on handling `.csv.gz` files effectively in the documentation relevant to CSV file handling. \n\n- **YouTube Resources**: Consider watching practical video guidance from practitioners who share strategies for loading data effectively in your specific use case.\n\nIf you're still having issues after trying these suggestions, please provide more details about your data loading process, and I can help troubleshoot further!",

This method is generally reliable and avoids issues related to licensing changes.\n\n2. **Using Homebrew:**\n   - Be aware that there can be conflicts when installing with Homebrew, especially between Docker Desktop and command-line tools. To avoid issues:\n     \n     - Install Docker Desktop first.\n     - Then install the command line tools.\n\n   - Commands:\n     \n     ```bash\n     brew install --cask docker\n     ```\n     \n     ```bash\n     brew install docker docker-compose\n     ```\n\n   - For more detailed issues related to `brew install`, refer to this [Issue](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/issues/16309). \n\nFor more details, you can check the article on [Setting up Docker in macOS](https://medium.com/@vivekslair/setting-up-docker-in-macos-ee36d37b3be2).",

This means you are not required to perform a `docker login` to fetch them.\n\nIf you encounter the message:\n\n```\ndocker login': denied: requested access to the resource is denied.\n```\n\nThis is likely due to a typo in your image name. For instance:\n\n```bash\n$ docker pull dbpage/pgadmin4\n```\n\nThis command will throw an exception:\n\n```\nError response from daemon: pull access denied for dbpage/pgadmin4, repository does not exist or may require 'docker login': denied: requested access to the resource is denied\n```\n\nThis occurs because the actual image name is `dpage/pgadmin4`, not `dbpage/pgadmin4`.\n\n**How to fix it:**\n\n```bash\n$ docker pull dpage/pgadmin4\n```\n\n**Extra Notes:** In some professional environments, the Docker image may be in a private repository that your DockerHub username has access to.

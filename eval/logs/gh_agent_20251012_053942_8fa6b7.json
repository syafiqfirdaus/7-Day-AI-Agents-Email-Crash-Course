You might encounter the following error:\n\n```bash\nerror: Error while reading table: trips_data_all.external_fhv_tripdata, error message: Parquet column 'DOlocationID' has type INT64 which does not match the target cpp_type DOUBLE.\n```\n\n### Solution:\nFix the data type issue in the data pipeline:\n\n1. Before injecting data into GCS, use `astype` and `Int64` (which is different from `int64` and accepts both missing values and integers) to cast the columns.\n\n    Example:\n    ```python\n    df[\"PUlocationID\"] = df.PUlocationID.astype(\"Int64\")\n    df[\"DOlocationID\"] = df.DOlocationID.astype(\"Int64\")\n    ```\n\n2.

          "content": "To avoid schema inconsistency issues in BigQuery, you should consider the following guidelines regarding data types:\n\n1. **Consistent Data Types:** Ensure that the data types of your columns in BigQuery match the data types used in your data files (such as Parquet). For example, if you have columns defined as `Int64` in BigQuery, ensure that the corresponding data in your Parquet files is also compatible. If you have nullable integers, consider using `Int64` in Pandas to accommodate missing values before loading.\n\n2. **Recommended Data Types:** Use appropriate BigQuery data types that match the nature of your data. For instance:\n   - Use `STRING` for textual data.\n   - Use `TIMESTAMP` for date and time values.\n   - For numeric values, `FLOAT64` or `NUMERIC` types should be used depending on the needed precision. Avoid using `FLOAT` for columns that might have integer values to prevent implicit type conversion issues.\n\n3. **Handling Missing Values:** When dealing with missing values in Pandas, utilize `astype(\"Int64\")` for integer columns to allow for nullable types in BigQuery, which helps maintain schema consistency. For example:\n   ```python\n   df[\"PUlocationID\"] = df.PUlocationID.astype(\"Int64\")\n   df[\"DOlocationID\"] = df.DOlocationID.astype(\"Int64\")\n   ```\n\n4. **Define Data Types Explicitly During ETL:** It's best to define the data types of all columns during the Transformation phase of your ETL process before loading to BigQuery. This proactive measure helps avoid type mismatches post-loading.\n\nBy following these practices, you can reduce the risk of schema inconsistency issues when working with BigQuery.\n\nFor more detailed implementations and examples, you can refer to the sources:\n- [Handling type error from BigQuery and Parquet data](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/faq/blob/main/faq-main/_questions/data-engineering-zoomcamp/module-3/023_66d3c42dd4_gcp-bq-how-to-handle-type-error-from-bigquery-and.md)\n- [Invalid data types after ingesting FHV data through parquet files](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/faq/blob/main/faq-main/_questions/data-engineering-zoomcamp/module-4/076_05aad03ef3_invalid-data-types-after-ingesting-fhv-data-throug.md)",

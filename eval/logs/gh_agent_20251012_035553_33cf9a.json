In some cases, after running `docker compose up`, the mounting directory created is named `docker_sql_dtc_postgres_volume_local` instead of the existing `dtc_postgres_volume_local`.\n\n3.

Here's a common fix:\n\nInstead of defining a host path like this:\n```yaml\nvolumes:\n  - \"./pgadmin:/var/lib/pgadmin:wr\"\n```\nYou should define a named Docker volume to ensure data persistence:\n```yaml\nvolumes:\n  pgadmin:\n```\nThen update your services in the `docker-compose.yml` accordingly:\n```yaml\npgadmin:\n  ...\n  volumes:\n    - pgadmin:/var/lib/pgadmin\n```\nThis method ensures that your PGAdmin and PostgreSQL data persist across container restarts and are managed by Docker volumes instead of being dependent on the host filesystem, which may have permissions or access issues.\n\nFor further details, you can refer to the full documentation [here](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/faq/blob/main/faq-main/_questions/data-engineering-zoomcamp/module-1/042_ac52bea382_docker-compose-persist-pgadmin-docker-contents-on.md).",

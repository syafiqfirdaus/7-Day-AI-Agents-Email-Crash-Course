You can follow detailed instructions for installation [here](https://pureinfotech.com/install-wsl-windows-11/).\n\n2. **Install Terraform**: Once WSL is set up, open your WSL terminal and download Terraform. You can get the latest version of Terraform for Linux from the HashiCorp releases page, or you can use the following command to download and install Terraform directly:\n\n   ```bash\n   wget https://releases.hashicorp.com/terraform/{version}/terraform_{version}_linux_amd64.zip\n   unzip terraform_{version}_linux_amd64.zip\n   sudo mv terraform /usr/local/bin/\n   ```\n\n   Replace `{version}` with the desired version number (e.g., 1.1.3).\n\n3. **Verify Installation**: After installing, verify that Terraform is installed successfully by running the following command in your WSL terminal:\n\n   ```bash\n   terraform -version\n   ```\n\n4. **Start Using Terraform**: You can start creating your Terraform configuration files and using Terraform commands like `terraform init`, `terraform plan`, and `terraform apply`.\n\nFor detailed guidance, you can refer to the [Configuring Terraform on Windows 10 Linux Subsystem](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/azure-developer-community-blog/configuring-terraform-on-windows-10-linux-sub-system/ba-p/393845) document.\n\nYou can also refer to specific Terraform installation details for WSL in the following source: [Terraform: Install for WSL](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/faq/blob/main/faq-main/_questions/data-engineering-zoomcamp/module-1/116_a5a163f51d_terraform-install-for-wsl.md).",

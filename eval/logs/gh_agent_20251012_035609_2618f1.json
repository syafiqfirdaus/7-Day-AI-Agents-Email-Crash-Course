Here are a couple of suggestions for managing storage:\n\n- **Clean up your GCP VM drive:** Use the command below to identify what is taking up the most space:\n\n  ```bash\n  sudo du -sh *\n  ```\n\n  - **(~1GB)** For me, the Anaconda installer was consuming a lot of space. If you no longer need it, you can delete it:\n  \n    ```bash\n    rm -rf <anacondainstaller_fpath>\n    ```\n\n  - **(~3GB)** Anaconda itself takes up a lot of space. You can\u2019t delete it entirely if you need Python, but you can clean it up significantly:\n    \n    ```bash\n    conda clean --all -y\n    ```\n\n- **Clean up your Kestra files:** Use a purge flow. You can find a generic example here:\n  \n  [https://kestra.io/docs/administrator-guide/purge](https://kestra.io/docs/administrator-guide/purge)\n  \n  I wanted to perform the cleanup immediately, rather than waiting until the end of the month, so I adjusted the `endDate` to `\"{{ now() }}\"` and removed the trigger block. You can also choose whether to remove FAILED state executions.\n\n- **Clean up your PostgreSQL database:** You can manually delete tables in pgAdmin, or set up a workflow in Kestra for it. I found it easy to do manually.",

For instance, if an installation of Anaconda is taking up space, you might remove it using:\n   ```bash\n   rm -rf <anacondainstaller_fpath>\n   ```\n   Additionally, to clean up Anaconda files that are no longer needed, run:\n   ```bash\n   conda clean --all -y\n   ```\n\n3. **Clean up Application-Specific Data**: If you're using applications like Kestra or PostgreSQL, consider purging unnecessary data:\n   - For Kestra, you can use a purge flow to remove old files. The documentation for purging can be found [here](https://kestra.io/docs/administrator-guide/purge).\n   - For PostgreSQL, delete unnecessary tables or set up workflows to manage data more effectively.\n\n4. **Consider Increasing Disk Size**: If managing space through cleanup isn't enough, you may consider resizing your VM's disk. This can be done through the GCP console.\n\nFor detailed instructions, you can refer to the mentioned resources in the documentation:\n- [Running out of storage when using Kestra with postgres on GCP VM](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/faq/blob/main/faq-main/_questions/data-engineering-zoomcamp/module-2/007_00e8093b90_running-out-of-storage-when-using-kestra-with-post.md)\n\nImplementing these steps should help you manage and mitigate storage issues on your GCP VM.",

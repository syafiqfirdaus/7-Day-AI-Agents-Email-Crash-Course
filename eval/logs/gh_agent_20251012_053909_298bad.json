You might encounter the following error:\n\n```bash\nerror: Error while reading table: trips_data_all.external_fhv_tripdata, error message: Parquet column 'DOlocationID' has type INT64 which does not match the target cpp_type DOUBLE.\n```\n\n### Solution:\nFix the data type issue in the data pipeline:\n\n1. Before injecting data into GCS, use `astype` and `Int64` (which is different from `int64` and accepts both missing values and integers) to cast the columns.\n\n    Example:\n    ```python\n    df[\"PUlocationID\"] = df.PUlocationID.astype(\"Int64\")\n    df[\"DOlocationID\"] = df.DOlocationID.astype(\"Int64\")\n    ```\n\n2.

              "content": "```\nImportError: DLL load failed while importing cimpl: The specified module could not be found\n```\n\n### Steps to Resolve:\n\n1. **Verify Python Version:**\n   \n   Ensure you are using a compatible version of Python with the Avro library. Check the Python version and compatibility requirements specified by the Avro library documentation.\n\n2. **Load Required DLL:**\n   \n   You may need to load `librdkafka-5d2e2910.dll` in your code before importing Avro. Add the following:\n   \n   ```python\n   from ctypes import CDLL\n\n   CDLL(\"C:\\\\Users\\\\YOUR_USER_NAME\\\\anaconda3\\\\envs\\\\dtcde\\\\Lib\\\\site-packages\\\\confluent_kafka.libs\\\\librdkafka-5d2e2910.dll\")\n   ```\n   \n   Note that this error may occur depending on the OS and Python version installed.\n\n3. **Alternative Solution:**\n\n   If you encounter `ImportError: DLL load failed while importing cimpl`, you can try the following solution in PowerShell:\n\n   ```bash\n   $env:CONDA_DLL_SEARCH_MODIFICATION_ENABLE=1\n   ```\n\n   This sets the DLL manually in the Conda environment.\n\n### Source:\n\n[Confluent-Kafka Python Issue #1186](https://githubhot.com/repo/confluentinc/confluent-kafka-python/issues/1186?page=2)",

Instead, always use the `dbt-athena-community` package, ensuring it matches the version of `dbt-core` to avoid compatibility conflicts.\n\n### Best Practice\n\n- **Always pin the versions of `dbt-core` and `dbt-athena-community` to the same version.**\n  \n  ```\n  Example: dbt-core~=1.9.3 dbt-athena-community~=1.9.3\n  ```\n\n### Why?\n\n- `dbt-athena-adapter` is outdated and no longer maintained.\n- `dbt-athena-community` is the actively maintained package and is compatible with the latest versions of `dbt-core`.\n\n### Steps to Avoid Conflicts\n\n1. **Check the compatibility matrix** in the [dbt-athena-community](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-adapters/tree/main/dbt-athena-community) GitHub repository.\n2. **Update `requirements.txt`** to use the latest compatible versions of `dbt-core` and `dbt-athena-community`.\n3. **Avoid mixing** `dbt-athena-adapter` with `dbt-athena-community` in the same environment.\n\nBy following this practice, you can avoid the conflicts we faced previously and ensure a smooth development experience.",

Verify the Python version and check for compatibility requirements in the Avro library documentation.\n\n2. **Install the Avro Module:**\n   If you're seeing a `ModuleNotFoundError`, you may need to install the Avro module explicitly. You can do this by running the following command:\n   ```bash\n   pip install confluent-kafka[avro]\n   ```\n   This is particularly important if you're using Conda environments, as it may not include the Avro module when installing `confluent-kafka`.\n\n3. **Load Required DLL (if applicable):**\n   If you encounter a specific error message like `ImportError: DLL load failed while importing cimpl`, you might need to load the required DLL manually in your code. Here's how to do it:\n   ```python\n   from ctypes import CDLL\n   CDLL(\"C:\\\\Users\\\\YOUR_USER_NAME\\\\anaconda3\\\\envs\\\\dtcde\\\\Lib\\\\site-packages\\\\confluent_kafka.libs\\\\librdkafka-5d2e2910.dll\")\n   ```\n\n4. **Set DLL Search Path (if needed):**\n   If loading the DLL doesn't resolve the issue, try setting the environment variable in PowerShell:\n   ```bash\n   $env:CONDA_DLL_SEARCH_MODIFICATION_ENABLE=1\n   ```\n\nBy taking these steps, you should be able to resolve any import errors related to the Avro library.

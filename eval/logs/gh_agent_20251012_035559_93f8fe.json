This means you are not required to perform a `docker login` to fetch them.\n\nIf you encounter the message:\n\n```\ndocker login': denied: requested access to the resource is denied.\n```\n\nThis is likely due to a typo in your image name. For instance:\n\n```bash\n$ docker pull dbpage/pgadmin4\n```\n\nThis command will throw an exception:\n\n```\nError response from daemon: pull access denied for dbpage/pgadmin4, repository does not exist or may require 'docker login': denied: requested access to the resource is denied\n```\n\nThis occurs because the actual image name is `dpage/pgadmin4`, not `dbpage/pgadmin4`.\n\n**How to fix it:**\n\n```bash\n$ docker pull dpage/pgadmin4\n```\n\n**Extra Notes:** In some professional environments, the Docker image may be in a private repository that your DockerHub username has access to. In this case, you must:\n\n1. Execute:\n   ```bash\n   $ docker login\n   ```\n2. Enter your username and password.\n3. Then perform the `docker pull` against that private repository.",

Ensure the Docker service is started.\n\n2. **Starting the Docker daemon**:\n   - On most systems, you can start Docker with the following command:\n     ```bash\n     sudo systemctl start docker\n     ```\n   - For Windows using WSL, ensure that WSL is updated with:\n     ```bash\n     wsl --update\n     ```\n\n3. **Troubleshooting common issues**:\n   - If you receive an error like `Cannot connect to Docker daemon at unix:///var/run/docker.sock`, it indicates that the daemon is likely not running or there's a permissions issue.\n   - Check the Docker service status with:\n     ```bash\n     sudo systemctl status docker\n     ```\n   - If there are any configuration issues or the service failed to start, the status command should provide detail on what went wrong.\n\n4. **Permissions issues**:\n   - Make sure your user has permissions to interact with the Docker daemon. You might need to add your user to the `docker` group with:\n     ```bash\n     sudo usermod -aG docker $USER\n     ```\n   - After running this command, log out and back in for the changes to take effect.\n\n5. **Reboot your system**:\n   - Sometimes, simply rebooting your machine can resolve issues related to the Docker daemon not running.\n\nFor more detailed troubleshooting, consider reviewing this documentation: [Docker: Cannot connect to Docker daemon at unix:///var/run/docker.sock.
